    ! called  repeatedly  with new values of xend without having to change *

    !     with ind = -2 the value of hmin  is  greater  than  hmax,  which *

    !     options - if the subroutine is entered with ind = 1, the first 9 *
    ! components of the communications vector are initialized to zero, and *
    ! the subroutine uses only default values  for  each  option.  if  the *
    ! subroutine  is  entered  with ind = 2, the user must specify each of *
    ! these 9 components - normally he would first set them all  to  zero, *
    ! and  then  make  non-zero  those  that  correspond to the particular *
    ! options he wishes to select. in any event, options may be changed on *
    ! re-entry  to  the  subroutine  -  but if the user changes any of the *
    ! options, or tol, in the course of a calculation he should be careful *
    ! about  how  such changes affect the subroutine - it may be better to *
    ! restart with ind = 1 or 2. (components 10 to 24 of c are used by the *
    ! program  -  the information is available to the user, but should not *

    !           uses the default value of hmax*(tol)**(1/6)                *

    !           hmax  (as  described  below) and second, by tightening the *
    !           acceptance requirement - if c(5) is zero, a default  value *
    !           of  1  is  used.  for  linear  homogeneous  problems  with *
    !           constant coefficients, an appropriate value for scale is a *
    !           norm  of  the  associated  matrix.  for other problems, an *
    !           approximation to  an  average  value  of  a  norm  of  the *
    !           jacobian along the trajectory may be appropriate           *

<hr>
CAMB is a Python and Fortran code for computing CMB, CMB lensing, lensing, galaxy count and dark-age 21cm power spectra, transfer functions and matter power spectra, and background cosmological functions.
For latest information on this program see <A HREF="http://camb.info">camb.info</A>.
<p>
 Often it is easiest and most flexible to just use the <A HREF="https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Python version</A>, which includes a command-line "camb" script. This
 readme instead focuses on using the compiled binary Fortran command-line version.
CAMB can also be used as part of the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/">CosmoMC</A> and <a href="https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Cobaya</a> parameter estimation packages.

Challinor. <br>
Originally based on CMBFAST developed by Uros Seljak and Matias
Zaldarriaga, itself based on Boltzmann code written by
Edmund Bertschinger, Chung-Pei Ma and Paul Bode.

<A NAME="compiling">
<B>Compiling and running</B>
</P>
To install and compile yourself you will need a Fortran 2008 (or higher) compiler - you can get the free <A HREF="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries">gfortran</A> compiler (version 6 or higher), or the optimized Intel compiler <em>ifort</em> is installed on many academic clusters and also supports integrated development and debugging in Visual Studio under Windows.
 Alternatively you can use CAMB in the pre-configured <A HREF="https://cosmologist.info/CosmoBox">CosmoBox</A> virtual machine. <P>


To install the Fortran binary from the command line:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="https://camb.info/CAMBsubmit.html">Download</A> CAMB
<li>If cloning using git, add <b>--recurse-submodules</b> to get the forutils submodule as well</li>
<LI>If downloading unzip the file (<B>tar xfv filename </B> for tar.gz); all files will be extracted to a
directory called "CAMB-xxx". Note you need <a href="https://github.com/cmbant/forutils">forutils</a> library in the forutils directory.
<LI>Change to the fortran directory (<b>cd fortran</b>)</LI>
<LI>Run <B>make</B> to compile everything you will need. (you may need to
edit the supplied Makefile, see below)
<LI>Run <B>./camb ../inifiles/params.ini</B>, where params.ini is a file
 of parameter values (sample supplied). The params.ini file should be
 fairly self-explanatory. The Fortran program should be run from the fortran directory (in order find the .dat template file that it loads).
<LI>To install and use the Python CAMB wrapper see the <A HREF="https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Python CAMB</A> documentation. After in installing with pip this also has a command-line camb script that will be built automatically with the python version - no need to compile the fortran code directly, and it can be run from any directory.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The Makefile comes set up for gfortran and  ifort compilers. Edit the relevant parts of the Makefile to compile on other systems. If you have Intel's Visual Fortran you can use the projects in the VisualStudio folder, no need to use the Makefile. To run on multi-processor machines add the -openmp (or equivalent) option to the Makefile's FFLAGS parameter to compile a parallelized (OPENMP) version.
</P>
<P>
 For a demo of how to use CAMB with the python wrapper see the <A HREF="https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CAMBdemo.html">demo notebook</A>.
For some further technical details about the algorithms, equations and code see the <A HREF="https://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">CAMB notes</A>.

</P>
<A NAME="inputs">
<H3>Input parameters</H3>
<P>
The params.ini file specifies the parameters used to run the program. Comments in params.ini should make this fairly self-explanatory,
more complicated cases, for example to run with multiple neutrino mass eigenstates and sterile neutrinos at different temperatures
see the documentation and examples in the <A HREF="https://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">CAMB notes</A>. To produce the matter power spectrum in addition to CMB C<sub>l</sub> set <b>get_transfer = T</b>; the <b>do_nonlinear</b> input parameter determines whether this is output as the linear power spectrum or includes non-linear corrections from the Halofit model.
<P>
The default params.ini file produces results in &mu;K<sup>2</sup> from the given primordial curvature perturbation power (<B>scalar_amp</B>) on 0.05 MPc<sup>-1</sup> scales. To get unnormalized dimensionless results set <B>scalar_amp=1</B> and <B>CMB_outputscale=1</B>. To compute lensed C<sub>l</sub>s you must set the normalization to some realistic value (the calculation is non-linear, so normalization matters).
<P>
<A NAME="outputs">
<H3>Outputs</H3>
Unlensed scalar angular power spectra are output to <b>output_root</b>_scalCls.dat. The columns are
<BLOCKQUOTE>
l C<sub>TT</sub> C<sub>EE</sub> C<sub>TE</sub> [C<sub>&Phi;</sub> C<sub>&Phi;T</sub>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here all C<sub>X</sub> are l(l+1)C_l/2pi except for C<sub>&Phi;</sub> and C<sub>&Phi;T</sub> which are C<sub>&Phi;</sub>= l<sup>4</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;</sup>, where  C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;</sup> is the (CMB) lensing potential power spectrum, and C<sub>&Phi;T</sub> = l<sup>3</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;T</sup>. The lensing terms in square brackets are only produced if <b>do_lensing = T</b>. If <b>CMB_outputscale = 7.4311e12</B> ([T<sub>CMB</sub>10<sup>6</sup>]<sup>2</sup>, the default), the units are &mu;K<sup>2</sup>. Note that lensing spectra are also multiplied by CMB_outputscale, so you may want to divide this out of the answer to get a sensible dimensionless spectrum or use the <b>lens_potential_output_file</b> file mentioned below. If requested the lensed power spectrum is output to <b>output_root</b>_lensedCls.dat
<P>
Tensor  angular power spectra are output to <b>output_root</b>_tensCls.dat if requested.
The columns are
<BLOCKQUOTE>
l C<sub>TT</sub> C<sub>EE</sub> C<sub>BB</sub>  C<sub>TE</sub>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If scalars and tensors are generated, the total spectrum is in <b>output_root</b>_totCls.dat, in the same format as the tensor output file.
<P>
If <b>do_lensing=T</b> and <b>lens_potential_output_file</b> is specified a file is output containing unlensed scalar (+tensor if calculated) spectra along with the lensing potentials in this format:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
l C<sub>TT</sub> C<sub>EE</sub> C<sub>BB</sub>  C<sub>TE</sub> C<sub>dd</sub> C<sub>dT</sub> C<sub>dE</sub>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where as before C<sub>X</sub> are l(l+1)C<sub>l</sub>/2&pi;, and d is the deflection angle, so C<sub>dd</sub>=[l(l+1)]<sup>2</sup>C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;</sup>/2&pi;,  C<sub>dT</sub>=[l(l+1)]<sup>3/2</sup>C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;T</sup>/2&pi;,
C<sub>dE</sub>=[l(l+1)]<sup>3/2</sup>C<sub>l</sub><sup>&Phi;E</sup>/2&pi;. These are the spectra required for simulating lensed skies using <A HREF="https://cosmologist.info/lenspix">LensPix</A>.

where Delta_X is defined as (delta rho_X)/rho_X  in the synchronous gauge and evaluated at the requested redshift, given a unit primordial curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales (for adiabatic modes, chi_0=-1).
The column numbers correspond to the Transfer_xx integer constants  defined in the Transfer module (results.f90).
<p>
<b>output_root</b>_matterpower.dat contains the conventionally normalized matter power spectrum (for baryons+cdm+massive neutrinos), in h/Mpc units.

<P>
<A NAME="coding">
<H3>Compilation options and code modifications</H3>
<P>
The Makefile should work out of the box in most cases for ifort and gfortran.
If you define your own new classes, or want to compile with  <A HREF="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jchluba/Science/CosmoRec/CosmoRec.html">CosmoRec</A> or <A HREF="https://github.com/nanoomlee/HYREC-2">HyRec</A> recombination support, you can edit the file list variables at the top of Makefile_main.
 You can also use e.g. <B>make RECOMBINATION_FILES="recfast cosmorec"</b> to override the default and compile with additional files.
 REIONIZATION is by default a simple relatively fast single-step reionization model (following <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3865">arXiv:0804.3865</A>), but you could add alternative models by implementing other derived classes.
</P>
<P>
It's rarely needed, but you can power spectrum produce files in  <A
HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">FITS</A>
 format - to do this you will need to have <A
HREF="http://www.eso.org/science/healpix/">HEALPIX</A> installed and make
 some edits to the Makefile - see the Makefile for details. After compiling with <B>make camb_fits</B>,
 you can then use <B>camb_fits</B> instead of <B>camb</B> - the FITS file
 produced is given the name specified in params.ini. Note that the FITS file format for polarization changed with HEALPIX 1.2, CAMB uses the new format.
</P>
<P>
All the equations that need to be modified for
simple non-standard models are in the equations.f90 file, or an in separate classes like the dark energy model.
<P>
After modifying any of the source code run <B>make clean</B> before running <B>make</B> to recompile (Visual Fortran will re-compile dependent code automatically).
Run <B>make all</B> to build a library libcamb.a that you can use when
linking to other programs. (You will also need to include the module files using -I/cambfolder).
<P>
See the <a href="https://camb.info/doc/classes/_index.html">class hierarchy</a> for how the different components of the calculation are structured.
Some details about what different source code files do are given <A HREF="#FILES">below</A>, see also the <A HREF="https://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">CAMB notes</A>.
<P>
A test suite is included, and will run automatically on <A HREF="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</A> when committing or making pull requests on the <A HREF="https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB">GitHub repository</A>.
    Python unit tests are in the camb.tests, and scripts for comparing outputs for a variety of models (as run on Travis) are in the tests directory.

<A NAME="FILES">
<H3>The source files</H3>
<P>
See the  <a href="https://camb.info/doc/">auto-generated source documentation</a>, and a few details below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>camb.f90</B>
<P>
Main wrapper routines for running CAMB in your fortran programs. Add "use
camb" to your programs and call CAMB_GetResults to generate output
from a set of model parameters (specified in the CAMBparams type -
defined in model.f90). You can call
CAMB_ValidateParams(P) to check that the parameter set is valid, use
CAMB_GetAge to compute the age of a model in gigayears, and
CAMB_GetCls to retrieve the computed Cls. <P>
Sample programs tester.f90 and sigma8.f90 are supplied showing how to
use CAMB from your own programs. You can also use CAMB_GetTransfers to access the C_l transfer functions directly without incorporating the initial power spectrum. In addition this module provides the routines to read settings from a .ini file.
</P>
<B>cmbmain.f90</B>
<P>
The main subroutine that does integrations, etc.
<P>
<B>equations.f90</B>
<P>
Files containing background and perturbation evolution equations. The
perturbations equations used are derived in the covariant approach,
fixing to the CDM (zero acceleration) frame, which are essentially
equivalent to the synchronous gauge equations.
<P>
   The file defines a module called &quot;GaugeInterface&quot; which provides
   the necessary perturbation calculation routines for
   &quot;cmbmain&quot;.
<P>
   The subroutine dtauda(a) returns dt/da and is used wherever the
   background evolution is needed. It
   can be modified for different backgrounds. If you add additional
   components, and can edit the init_background routine to do
   additional initialization.
    <P>
   outtransf writes out the matter transfer functions.
<P>
   The "output" subroutine computes the scalar sources at a given time for a
   given wavenumber. These are the temperature, E polarization and (if
   doing lensing) the lensing source. By editing the equation for the
   lensing source it should be straightforward to compute power
   spectra for other matter tracers, e.g. for cross-correlation with
   the CMB. The lensing power spectrum is automatically computed if
   <B>DoLensing=T</B>.
<P>
<B> InitialPower.f90</B>
<P>
This file defines a module called InitialPower with classes returning the
initial power spectra. Comments in the code explain this further.
<P>

<P>
<B> reionization.f90</B>
<P>
This file defines a module called Reionization that provides a class implementing a tanh-parameterization of the reionization history. The class gives x<sub>e</sub> as a function of redshift. Optical depth input parameters are mapped into z<sub>re</sub> (defined as where x<sub>e</sub> is half its maximum (ex second He reionization)) using a binary search. See the CAMB <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">notes</A> for discussion. This module should be easily modifiable for alternative reionization models.
<P>
<B>halofit.f90</B><P>
Implements the NonLinearModel class, to calculate non-linear scalings of the matter power spectrum as a function of redshift. Uses HALOFIT (<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207664">astro-ph/0207664</A>, code thanks to <A HREF="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p330705-robert-e-smith">Robert Smith</A>, with tweaks
from <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2701">arXiv:1208.2701</A> (thanks Ryuichi Takahashi) - see that paper for discussion of numerical accuracy. This module can be replaced to use a different non-linear fitting method if desired.

<P>
 <B> inidriver.f90</B>
<P>
    Reads in parameters from a file of name/value pairs and calls CAMB.
<P>
 <B>model.f90</B>
<P>
 Defined CAMBparams input parameter types.
<P>

<P>
 <B>results.f90</B>
<P>
  Defines types used by calculated intermediate results (e.g. time interpolation tables), and outputs like CAMBdata and transfer functions
<P>

 <B>bessels.f90</B>
<P>
   Module to calculate spherical and hyper-spherical Bessel
   functions. Hyper-spherical functions generated by use of
   either the recursion relation or Kosowsky's WKB approximation. Based on
   Arthur Kosowsky's &quot;hyperjl.c&quot;.
<P>

<B>lensing.f90</B>
<P>
  Lensing module for computing the lensed CMB power spectra from the
  unlensed spectra and a lensing power spectrum. See <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502425">astro-ph/0502425</A>.
</P>

 <B> subroutines.f90</B>
<P>
   Various subroutines for interpolation, and modified Runge-Kutta
   dverk for parallelized evolution.
<P>
<B> writefits.f90</B>
<P>
 Subroutine WriteFitsCls that uses HEALPIX routines to output power spectrum
 in FITS format. Not usually used (also not tested regularly).
 <P>
<B>recfast.f90</B>
<P>
 RECFAST integrator for Cosmic Recombination of Hydrogen and Helium
 by Douglas Scott (with minor modifications for CMBFAST and the
 CAMB). See <A
 HREF="http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/recfast.html">RECFAST</A>
 for the original code. This module implements the TRecombinationModel class required by CAMB. Sample wrappers are also provided for <A HREF="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jchluba/Science/CosmoRec/CosmoRec.html">CosmoRec</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/nanoomlee/HYREC-2">HyRec</A>, but the libraries for these must be installed separately.
 <P>
<B>SeparableBispectrum.f90</B>
<P>
  Implements calculation of simple separable primordial bispectra, specifically the local constant f<sub>NL</sub> model, and the CMB lensing bispectrum due to the linear temperature and polarization cross-correlation with the lensing potential. Compile with FISHER defined in the makefile to also calculate Fisher elements, including the effects of lensing signal variance (edit Makefile to link to LAPACK if necessary). Note that the primordial bispectra here are unlensed (see <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4732">arXiv:0905.4732</a> for a calculation), but the lensed bispectra are calculated non-perturbatively (but approximately) using the lensed small-scale CMB power spectra. Note that calculating primordial bispectra is significantly slower than doing standard power spectrum calculations, however it parallelizes well.

  <P>
 <B>camb_python.f90</B>
<P>
  Interface functions for the python wrapper.

<A NAME="ACCURACY">
<H3>Accuracy</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scalar numerical errors should rarely exceed 0.3% and 0.1% for 500&lt;L&lt;3000. Matter power spectrum errors are usually dominated by interpolation in the acoustic oscillations, with about 0.2% accuracy (but much better rms accuracy). For a detailed study of numerical accuracy as of January 2012 see <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3654">arXiv:1201.3654</A>.
<p>
</p>
Accuracy of course assumes the model is correct, and is dependent on RECFAST being the correct ionization history. Lensed C_l TT, TE and EE are accurate at the same level  (to within the approximation that the lensing potential is linear, or the accuracy of the HALOFIT non-linear model).
<P>
 Extreme models (e.g. scale &gt; 4, h&gt;1) may give errors of 5% or more.
<P>
 Tensor errors around 2% or more on small scales (e.g. due to l-interpolation). Low l accuracy somewhat worse than scalars (typically < 1%). Turn on neutrinos in the input file for accurate results (automatic on high accuracy setting).
<P>
 Hierarchy truncation errors up to 5% at high l (&gt;1500) in some
   closed models
<P>
 You can improve or check accuracy (or increase speed) by changing
   global accuracy parameters at the bottom of the params.ini input file. Convergence and stability can be checked using the <A HREF="http://camb.info/test_suite.tar.gz">test suite</A>, and accuracy
   parameters can also be changed from the python version.

Added <B>do_nonlinear</B> option to apply non-linear corrections from HALOFIT (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207664">astro-ph/0207664</A>). <B>do_nonlinear = 1</B> applies just to the matter power spectra, <B>do_nonlinear=2</B> applies corrections to the lensed CMB power spectra (important for BB). HALOFIT should only be used for standard adiabatic &Lambda;CDM models with power law initial power spectra.
New <B>recombination</B> option (1 does RECFAST as before, 2 uses modified version from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501672">astro-ph/0501672</a>). New option <B>do_late_rad_trunction</B> to turn off the small scale radiation hierarchies after matter domination (see <A HREF="http://cosmocoffee.info/discuss/astro-ph/0503277">astro-ph/0503277</A> and the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">notes</A>) - saves some time.

New <B>accurate_BB</B> parameter to get lensed BB accurately (within assumptions of linearity and given k_max, l_max, etc.). Note lensed_output_file no longer contains any tensor contribution. Various changes for better accuracy and compiler compatibility, including same accuracy with massive neutrinos as with massless.

Flat Bessel functions no longer cached to disk (faster to compute than read in many cases; prevents problems in uses with MPI). New <B>accurate_reionization</B> flag for accurate calculation of large scale scalar EE around the first dip (also outputs computed optical depth due to reionization). Option to output vector mode spectra from regular vorticity mode (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403583">astro-ph/0403583</A>) or magnetic field (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406096">astro-ph/0406096</A>).

<I>Fix - 17 Dec:</I> corrected problem with significantly non-flat models (e.g. &Omega;<sub>K</sub>=-0.1, H<sub>0</sub>=40)
<P>
Improved accuracy of non-flat calculation, and allowed for very nearly flat models (&Omega;<sub>K</sub> ~ 1e-5). Non-flat code should be as accurate as the flat (0.5%) on most scales. Added run-time parameters <B>do_tensor_neutrinos</B> (to include the neutrino evolution in the tensor equations) and <B>cs2_lam</B> (constant sound speed of the dark energy) instead of having to modify the code. Fixed fatal bug in tensor neutrino setup introduced some time this year.

Some major restructuring, including new functions to return the CMB transfer functions (see camb.f90). The tight coupling code has been re-written, adding quadrupole terms and accounting for the time variation of the opacity numerically. The code should be more accurate and faster, especially on small scales. Minor fixes to RECFAST to match version in CMBFAST (0.01% effect on C<sub>l</sub>s), and bug fix in output routine (0.3%). Includes constant w dark energy and running spectral index parameters by default (rather than with an add-on). New <B>use_physical</B> parameter to allow alternative model specification by Om_b h^2, Om_b h^2 and Om_k. Polarization .fits files now compatible with HEALPIX 1.2.

spectrum for each mode) - new <B>initial_vector</B> parameter in
params.ini. Partially correlated mixed initial conditions can be
computed by combining results from different runs with totally
correlated initial conditions.
</P>

<B>July 2002</B>
<P>
Changes for compatibility with <A
HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/">CosmoMC</A>. New option to output matter power spectrum.
Changed default pivot point for tensor initial power spectrum to
0.002 MPc<sup>-1</sup> (power_tilt.f90), added pivot point and normalization to
initial power parameters. Minor enhancements to inifile.f90. Utility
routines Re_OpticalDepthAtZ and Transfer_GetMatterPower added to
modules.f90.
</P>

<B>March 2002</B>
<P>
Massive neutrino support improved. Background evolution is much
faster, and only ever needs to be computed once for all neutrino
masses. Output transfer function files now include columns for the
massive neutrino and total perturbations. Sigma_8 is now computed
including CDM, baryons and massive neutrinos.  Fixed problem computing matter
power spectrum in massive neutrino models. New parameter
<B>massive_nu_approx</B> to control
how the massive neutrinos are evolved - option for new approximate fast scheme
that is quite accurate for the CMB. New <B>feedback_level</B> parameter
that can be used to get useful information about the model being
calculated.
<BR>
Fixed rare problem computing closed models, and bug in computation of
closed transfer functions. The names of the massive neutrino
subroutines have been changed because the argument that is passed has changed.
</P>

<B>February 2002</B>
<P>
Fixed FITS file output to start at l=0 rather than l=2 to be consistent
with HEALPIX.
</P>
<B>January 2002</B>
<P>
The code is now fully internally parallelized and lensing is
supported. Can now use about 16 processors with good efficiency -
just compile with the OpenMP -mp compiler flag. The lensing power
spectrum is computed explicitly and then used to computed the lensed
CMB power spectra using the full-sky results of  <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001303">astro-ph/0001303</A> (many
thanks for Gayoung Chon for work on the lensed power spectrum
code). To generate the lensed power spectra set do_lensing=T in
params.ini and the output will be in the lensed_output_file. The lensing power spectrum l<sup>4</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&phi;&phi;</sup> is also output as the 5th
column of the scalar_output_file, followed by the cross-correlation
with the temperature l<sup>3</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&phi;T</sup>.

</P>

<B>October 2001</B><P>
Fixed bug in RECFAST - corrects C_l errors at 1-2% level. Background
evolution is now determined from routines in gauge_inv.f90 (and
gauge_sync.f90) - you now only need to edit these files to add
additional matter components, use extended theories, etc. RECFAST now
consistent with massive neutrinos.
Added Makefile for better compilation, and added option to create FITS
format power spectrum files. Changed driver.f90 to driver.F90, and new
file writefits.f90. Some minor changes to ease use with a
wider range of compilers (e.g. NaG F95 for Linux).
<P>
<B>May 2001</B><P>
Fixed the neutrino ratio factor in the normalization of the scalar
power spectrum to be consistent with the power spectrum as defined
since the January 2001 version. Changes to gauge_inv.f90 and gauge_sync.f90.
<P>
<B>April 2001</B><P>
New <A
HREF="http://camb.info/examples.html">example
code</A>. These samples show how you can call CAMB from other programs
via a subroutine. There are also improved InitialPower
modules for parameterizing the initial power spectrum to obtain
meaningful tensor/scalar ratios for general models and for
parameterizing in terms of slow-roll inflation parameters.<P>

Fixed a floating error arising when both tensor and scalar spectra are generated but
with ratio zero.
<P>

<B>February 2001</B><P>
Fixed bug in recfast.f90 introduced in August 2000 update (caused
erroneous blip in ionization history).<P>


<B>January 2001</B><P>
New file power.f90 added to separate out the InitialPower module for
easily modifying the initial power spectrum. The InitialPower module now has
additional parameters to control the normalization of the output Cls,
allowing absolute computations using correctly normalized initial
power spectra (set the UseScalTensRatio parameter to false to compute the
tensor/scalar ratio correctly from the initial power spectra in
general models). The InitialPower module is now commented to fully
explain the definition of the power spectra that should be returned by the TensorPower and
ScalarPower routines. <P>
The transfer functions are now output in terms of k rather than beta
(nu*K) in non-flat models,
and the way to compute the matter power spectrum from the transfer
functions via d2norm is documented. The variables used to propagate
the tensor modes in gauge_inv.f90 have been changed to be equivalent
to the metric variables, improving stability when DoTensorNeutrinos=true.
<P>
<B>September 2000</B><P>
Now uses an accurate approximation to propagate massive neutrino
perturbations once no longer highly relativistic, speeding up
computation by about a factor of two (gauge_inv routine only). All massive
neutrino code is now
re-organized into a module called MassiveNu in modules.f90. The massive
neutrino equations are described in  <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203507">astro-ph/0203507</A>
 <P>

<B>August 2000</B><P>
Minor changes to recfast.f90 and modules.f90 to prevent floating
point errors on some systems. (Thanks for Louise Griffiths)<P>

<B>July 2000</B><P>
Fixes inaccurate computation of the tensor quadrupole in flat
models, pointed out in <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006392">astro-ph/0006392</A> . The only code change is to subroutine TensSourceSumIntJl in cmbmain.f90.<P>

<B>February 2000</B><P>
Massive neutrinos are now supported. The treatment is essentially the
same as CMBFAST. However gauge_inv now includes neutrino anisotropic
stress in the tensor computation by default, accounting for massive neutrinos
when appropriate. You can revert to the old default by changing the
"DoTensorNeutrinos" parameter in gauge_inv.  <P>
This version also fixes the tight coupling switch over to give
accurate results with gauge_sync. This fixes errors introduced in
CMBFAST 3.0/CAMB Nov 99.
<P>
<B>November 1999</B><P>
Adds support for RECFAST recombination
and fixes various bugs that were in CMBFAST 2.4.1 but fixed in CMBFAST
3.0. RECFAST is an option via the fifth line in the input file as in
CMBFAST. Using it does not slow things down significantly and corrects
errors at around the 2% level.

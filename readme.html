Originally based on CMBFAST developed by Uros Seljak and Matias
Zaldarriaga, itself based on Boltzmann code written by
Edmund Bertschinger, Chung-Pei Ma and Paul Bode.

<P>
CAMB is also supplied as part of the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/">CosmoMC</A> parameter estimation package. For an extension including perturbed recombination, 21cm, lensing and number count sources see <A HREF="http://camb.info/sources">CAMB sources</A>.

<B>Compiling and running</B>
</P>
You will need a Fortran 90 (or higher) compiler - you can get free <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/downloads/forlin.htm" TARGET="_blank">Intel Linux</A>, <A HREF="http://g95.sourceforge.net/">G95</A> or <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">GFortran</A> compilers.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://camb.info/CAMBsubmit.html">Download</A> CAMB
<LI>Unzip and untar the file (<B>tar xfv CAMB.tar.gz</B>). All files will be extracted to a
directory called "CAMB".
<LI>Run <B>make</B> to compile everything you will need. (you may need to
edit the supplied Makefile, see below)
<LI>Run <B>./camb params.ini</B>, where params.ini is a file
 of parameter values (sample supplied). The params.ini file should be
 fairly self-explanatory.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The Makefile comes set up for Intel machines using ifc. Just comment the relevant parts to compile on different systems. If you have Compaq Visual Fortran you can open the supplied .dsp project file, no need to use the Makefile (currently Intel Visual Fortran is not recommended). To run on multi-processor machines add the -openmp (or equivalent) option to the Makefile's FFLAGS parameter to compile a parallelized (OPENMP) version.
</P>
<P>
You can also edit the Makefile's EQUATIONS and POWERSPECTRUM
 variables. The POWERSPECTRUM.f90  file contains a module giving the initial
 power spectrum, the EQUATIONS.f90 file contains the background evolution
 equations and sets of gauge-dependent perturbation
 equations. To avoid problems run <B>make clean</B> after changing the
 Makefile before recompiling.
</P>
<P>
You can produce files in  <A
HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">FITS</A>
 format - to do this you will need to have <A
HREF="http://www.eso.org/science/healpix/">HEALPIX</A> installed and make
 some edits to the Makefile - see the Makefile for details. After compiling with <B>make camb_fits</B>,
 you can then use <B>camb_fits</B> instead of <B>camb</B> - the FITS file
 produced is given the name specified in params.ini. Note that the FITS file format for polarization changed with HEALPIX 1.2, CAMB uses the new format.
</P>
<P>
All the equations that need to be modified for
simple non-standard models are in the equations.f90 file.  It should be possible to produce other files
for extended models (see the sample <A
HREF="http://camb.info/extra.html">quintessence</A> module). (Note that varying
constant - e.g. alpha -  models are not quite so simple to plug in).
<P>
After modifying any of the source code run <B>make clean</B> before running <B>make</B> to recompile (Visual Fortran will re-compile dependent code automatically).
Run <B>make all</B> to build a library libcamb.a that you can use when
linking to other programs. (You will also need to include the module files using -I/cambfolder).
<P>
As of November 2004 the supplied sample params.ini file produces results in &mu;K<sup>2</sup> from the given primordial curvature perturbation power (<B>scalar_amp</B>) on 0.05 MPc<sup>-1</sup> scales. To get unnormalized dimensionless results set <B>scalar_amp(1)=1</B> and <B>CMB_outputscale=1</B> (as in previous CAMB versions). To compute lensed C<sub>l</sub>s you must set the normalization to some realistic value (the calculation is non-linear, so normalization matters).
<P>
You can <A HREF="http://camb.info/test_suite.tar.gz">download</A> a test suite for comparing accuracy with different parameters and code versions. Just extract the file to your CAMB directory and read the readme.

<H3>Version History</H3>

<B>March 2008</B><BR>
<I>(26th March, fixed pivot parameters in sample .ini)</I><BR>
New reionization history model: new input parameter <B>re_delta_redshift</B> (does not change optical depth), and option to set <B>re_ionization_frac=-1</B> to automatically set the reionization fraction from input Y<sub>He</sub> assuming Helium is singly reionized at the same time as hydrogen (hence mapping of redshift to optical depth different to before at 10% level; see the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">notes</A>).  Reionization history now specified in (replaceable) module in reionization.f90; default includes tiny effect of He double reionization at z~3.5. Some internal reorganization.
Added <B>pivot_scalar</B> and <B>pivot_tensor</B> input parameters for initial power spectrum. <b>output</b> subroutine (equations.f90) re-arranged to separated ISW source terms.
<P>
<B>February 2008</B><BR>
Updated RECFAST to version 1.4 (~0.5% effect at high <I>l</I>; new RECFAST_fudge_He,RECFAST_Heswitch parameters, removed Dubrovich modifications). <B>lensed_total_output_file</b> parameter to get lensed scalar plus tensor power spectrum. Calculates CosmoMC's theta parameter for each model (code in modules.f90). Modules routine <B>MatterPowerData_Load</B> to read in matter power (for splining from pre-computed file); <B>MatterPowerData_k</B> function now extrapolates low-k out of range. <B>transfer_interp_matterpower</B> parameter to switch between interpolated regular grid in log k or array at actual computed values (better for later re-interpolation). Added camb.vfproj Intel Visual Fortran project file. Simplifying internal changes from <A HREF="http://camb.info/sources">CAMB sources</A>, e.g. use of Ranges module for setting time steps and k sampling values; also now switches to log k source spacing at very high l to speed up calculation where spectra smooth. More diagnostics and options in the  <A HREF="http://camb.info/test_suite.tar.gz">test suite</A>.
<P>
<B>November 2006</B><BR>
Updated RECFAST to version 1.3 (0.1% effect on C<sub>l</sub>). Tweak to get &lt;0.3% error in matter power spectrum around the peak when <B>transfer_high_precision = T</B>.
<P>
<B>September 2006</B><BR>
Fixed problem generating combinations of scalars and tensors in camb.f90 (since August version).
<P>
<B>August 2006</B><BR>
Speeded calculation of lensed spectra and lensing power spectrum by using Limber approximation on small scales (no loss of accuracy). Fixed missing f_K in source term for non-flat lensing potential. Minor changes to default parameters and compatibility tweaks. Can <A HREF="http://camb.info/test_suite.tar.gz">download</A> test suite for comparing accuracy and code versions.
<P>
<B>July 2006</B><BR>
Fixed bug setting default neutrino degeneracy if none specified and initialization of nu_mass_eigenstates for programmatic access. Other minor fixes.
<P>
<B>June 2006</B><BR>
Added support for arbitrary neutrino mass splittings. New option to set <B>transfer_k_per_logint=0</B> to get automatic accurate k-sampling of the matter power spectrum. Fixed Transfer_GetMatterPower at large scales for non-flat models. New setting value <B>massive_nu_approx=3</B> to use whatever method is good to get fast accurate results. Other internal changes.
<P>

<B>March 2006</B><BR>
Fixed bug lensing scalar spectrum when generated at the same time as tensors. New (hard coded) parameter <B>lmin</B> in modules.f90 - set to 1 if you want to generate temperature and lensing potential l=1 (Newtonian Gauge) C<sub>l</sub>.
<P>
<B>April 2005</B><BR>
Added <B>do_nonlinear</B> option to apply non-linear corrections from HALOFIT (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207664">astro-ph/0207664</A>). <B>do_nonlinear = 1</B> applies just to the matter power spectra, <B>do_nonlinear=2</B> applies corrections to the lensed CMB power spectra (important for BB). HALOFIT should only be used for standard adiabatic &Lambda;CDM models with power law initial power spectra.
New <B>recombination</B> option (1 does RECFAST as before, 2 uses modified version from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501672">astro-ph/0501672</a>). New option <B>do_late_rad_trunction</B> to turn off the small scale radiation hierarchies after matter domination (see <A HREF="http://cosmocoffee.info/discuss/astro-ph/0503277">astro-ph/0503277</A> and the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">notes</A>) - saves some time. New <B>output_root</B> option to prefix output file names and generate output_root_params.ini file of input parameters for the run.
<P>
<B>November 2004</B><BR>
Default lensing routine (<B>lensing_method=1</B>) changed to use new full-sky correlation function method (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502425">astro-ph/0502425</A>) in preference to the harmonic method of <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001303">astro-ph/0001303</A> (<B>lensing_method=3</B>; inaccurate at l>1000 at ~1.5% level by l=2000). The lensed result is now significantly faster and more accurate.
Also added flat-sky method (<B>lensing_method=2</B>) of <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9505109">astro-ph/9505109</A> and <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9803150">astro-ph/9803150</A> as in CMBFAST (accurate to 0.4%). New <B>accurate_BB</B> parameter to get lensed BB accurately (within assumptions of linearity and given k_max, l_max, etc.). Note lensed_output_file no longer contains any tensor contribution. Various changes for better accuracy and compiler compatibility, including same accuracy with massive neutrinos as with massless.
<P>
<B>August 2004</B><BR>
Fixed effect of reionization on the lensed C<sub>l</sub> (0.5% on small scale TT).
</P>
<B>June 2004</B><BR>
<P>
Fixed serious problem with tensor mode polarized C<sub>l</sub> from reionization (significantly underestimated power).
Changed default tensor pivot scale to 0.05 Mpc<sup>-1</sup> (same as for scalars). Flat Bessel functions no longer cached to disk (faster to compute than read in many cases; prevents problems in uses with MPI). New <B>accurate_reionization</B> flag for accurate calculation of large scale scalar EE around the first dip (also outputs computed optical depth due to reionization). Option to output vector mode spectra from regular vorticity mode (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403583">astro-ph/0403583</A>) or magnetic field (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406096">astro-ph/0406096</A>).
</P>
<B>December 2003</B><BR>
<I>Fix - 17 Dec:</I> corrected problem with significantly non-flat models (e.g. &Omega;<sub>K</sub>=-0.1, H<sub>0</sub>=40)
<P>
Improved accuracy of non-flat calculation, and allowed for very nearly flat models (&Omega;<sub>K</sub> ~ 1e-5). Non-flat code should be as accurate as the flat (0.5%) on most scales. Added run-time parameters <B>do_tensor_neutrinos</B> (to include the neutrino evolution in the tensor equations) and <B>cs2_lam</B> (constant sound speed of the dark energy) instead of having to modify the code. Fixed fatal bug in tensor neutrino setup introduced some time this year. Added parameter <B>CMB_outputscale</B> to scale output Cls by a constant (see comments in params.ini for getting microK^2 output).
</P>

<B>July 2003</B><BR>
<P>
Fixed instability in bessels.f90 which gave problem for very nearly flat closed models with abnormal Helium fractions (and possibly other models). Dark energy equations in equations.f90 changed to use simpler general fluid equations for the perturbations (see <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307104">astro-ph/0307104</A>). inidriver.F90 now reads in scalar amplitude even if computing tensors only (so combination with the initial ratio sets correct tensor amplitude).
</P>

<B>May 2003</B><BR>
<P>
Fixed bug in equations.f90 giving errors with non-flat models. Fixed bug in inidriver.F90 setting H<sub>0</sub> with <B>use_physical=F</B>. Fixed camb.f90 file in download - missing routines for getting C<sub>l</sub> transfer functions.
</P>
<B>April 2003</B><BR>
<P>
Some major restructuring, including new functions to return the CMB transfer functions (see camb.f90). The tight coupling code has been re-written, adding quadrupole terms and accounting for the time variation of the opacity numerically. The code should be more accurate and faster, especially on small scales. Minor fixes to RECFAST to match version in CMBFAST (0.01% effect on C<sub>l</sub>s), and bug fix in output routine (0.3%). Includes constant w dark energy and running spectral index parameters by default (rather than with an add-on). New <B>use_physical</B> parameter to allow alternative model specification by Om_b h^2, Om_b h^2 and Om_k. Polarization .fits files now compatible with HEALPIX 1.2.
</P>

<B>November 2002</B>
<P>
Minor changes for greater compiler compatibility, in particular with Visual Fortran. Makefile includes suggested options for a variety of compilers.
</P>

<B>September 2002</B>
<P>
Added support for neutrino isocurvature initial conditions, and
totally correlated mixed initial conditions (assuming the same power
spectrum for each mode) - new <B>initial_vector</B> parameter in
params.ini. Partially correlated mixed initial conditions can be
computed by combining results from different runs with totally
correlated initial conditions.
</P>

<B>July 2002</B>
<P>
Changes for compatibility with <A
HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/">CosmoMC</A>. New option to output matter power spectrum.
Changed default pivot point for tensor initial power spectrum to
0.002 MPc<sup>-1</sup> (power_tilt.f90), added pivot point and normalization to
initial power parameters. Minor enhancements to inifile.f90. Utility
routines Re_OpticalDepthAtZ and Transfer_GetMatterPower added to
modules.f90.
</P>

<B>March 2002</B>
<P>
Massive neutrino support improved. Background evolution is much
faster, and only ever needs to be computed once for all neutrino
masses. Output transfer function files now include columns for the
massive neutrino and total perturbations. Sigma_8 is now computed
including CDM, baryons and massive neutrinos.  Fixed problem computing matter
power spectrum in massive neutrino models. New parameter
<B>massive_nu_approx</B> to control
how the massive neutrinos are evolved - option for new approximate fast scheme
that is quite accurate for the CMB. New <B>feedback_level</B> parameter
that can be used to get useful information about the model being
calculated.
<BR>
Fixed rare problem computing closed models, and bug in computation of
closed transfer functions. The names of the massive neutrino
subroutines have been changed because the argument that is passed has changed.
</P>

<B>February 2002</B>
<P>
Fixed FITS file output to start at l=0 rather than l=2 to be consistent
with HEALPIX.
</P>
<B>January 2002</B>
<P>
The code is now fully internally parallelized and lensing is
supported. Can now use about 16 processors with good efficiency -
just compile with the OpenMP -mp compiler flag. The lensing power
spectrum is computed explicitly and then used to computed the lensed
CMB power spectra using the full-sky results of  <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001303">astro-ph/0001303</A> (many
thanks for Gayoung Chon for work on the lensed power spectrum
code). To generate the lensed power spectra set do_lensing=T in
params.ini and the output will be in the lensed_output_file. The lensing power spectrum l<sup>4</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&phi;&phi;</sup> is also output as the 5th
column of the scalar_output_file, followed by the cross-correlation
with the temperature l<sup>3</sup> C<sub>l</sub><sup>&phi;T</sup>.

</P>

<B>October 2001</B><P>
Fixed bug in RECFAST - corrects C_l errors at 1-2% level. Background
evolution is now determined from routines in gauge_inv.f90 (and
gauge_sync.f90) - you now only need to edit these files to add
additional matter components, use extended theories, etc. RECFAST now
consistent with massive neutrinos.
Added Makefile for better compilation, and added option to create FITS
format power spectrum files. Changed driver.f90 to driver.F90, and new
file writefits.f90. Some minor changes to ease use with a
wider range of compilers (e.g. NaG F95 for Linux).
<P>
<B>May 2001</B><P>
Fixed the neutrino ratio factor in the normalization of the scalar
power spectrum to be consistent with the power spectrum as defined
since the January 2001 version. Changes to gauge_inv.f90 and gauge_sync.f90.
<P>
<B>April 2001</B><P>
New <A
HREF="http://camb.info/examples.html">example
code</A>. These samples show how you can call CAMB from other programs
via a subroutine. There are also improved InitialPower
modules for parameterizing the initial power spectrum to obtain
meaningful tensor/scalar ratios for general models and for
parameterizing in terms of slow-roll inflation parameters.<P>

Fixed a floating error arising when both tensor and scalar spectra are generated but
with ratio zero.
<P>

<B>February 2001</B><P>
Fixed bug in recfast.f90 introduced in August 2000 update (caused
erroneous blip in ionization history).<P>


<B>January 2001</B><P>
New file power.f90 added to separate out the InitialPower module for
easily modifying the initial power spectrum. The InitialPower module now has
additional parameters to control the normalization of the output Cls,
allowing absolute computations using correctly normalized initial
power spectra (set the UseScalTensRatio parameter to false to compute the
tensor/scalar ratio correctly from the initial power spectra in
general models). The InitialPower module is now commented to fully
explain the definition of the power spectra that should be returned by the TensorPower and
ScalarPower routines. <P>
The transfer functions are now output in terms of k rather than beta
(nu*K) in non-flat models,
and the way to compute the matter power spectrum from the transfer
functions via d2norm is documented. The variables used to propagate
the tensor modes in gauge_inv.f90 have been changed to be equivalent
to the metric variables, improving stability when DoTensorNeutrinos=true.
<P>
<B>September 2000</B><P>
Now uses an accurate approximation to propagate massive neutrino
perturbations once no longer highly relativistic, speeding up
computation by about a factor of two (gauge_inv routine only). All massive
neutrino code is now
re-organized into a module called MassiveNu in modules.f90. The massive
neutrino equations are described in  <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203507">astro-ph/0203507</A>
 <P>

<B>August 2000</B><P>
Minor changes to recfast.f90 and modules.f90 to prevent floating
point errors on some systems. (Thanks for Louise Griffiths)<P>

<B>July 2000</B><P>
Fixes inaccurate computation of the tensor quadrupole in flat
models, pointed out in <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006392">astro-ph/0006392</A> . The only code change is to subroutine TensSourceSumIntJl in cmbmain.f90.<P>

<B>February 2000</B><P>
Massive neutrinos are now supported. The treatment is essentially the
same as CMBFAST. However gauge_inv now includes neutrino anisotropic
stress in the tensor computation by default, accounting for massive neutrinos
when appropriate. You can revert to the old default by changing the
"DoTensorNeutrinos" parameter in gauge_inv.  <P>
This version also fixes the tight coupling switch over to give
accurate results with gauge_sync. This fixes errors introduced in
CMBFAST 3.0/CAMB Nov 99.
<P>
<B>November 1999</B><P>
Adds support for RECFAST recombination
and fixes various bugs that were in CMBFAST 2.4.1 but fixed in CMBFAST
3.0. RECFAST is an option via the fifth line in the input file as in
CMBFAST. Using it does not slow things down significantly and corrects
errors at around the 2% level.

<A NAME="COMPARE">
<H3>Comparison with CMBFAST</H3>
This code was originally developed from CMBFAST 2.4.1 to support closed models
and gauge invariant variables. After releasing this code CMBFAST 3.2
was released which also supports closed models. These codes were
developed independently and so are somewhat different, and both codes
have developed independently since then.
<P>
The main differences in the non-flat computation lie in how we perform the integral of the source
functions with the hyperspherical Bessel functions. We use
Kosowsky's WKB approximation or the recursion relation to evaluate the Bessel
functions at the starting point of ranges of integration, and then
integrate the differential equation. CMBFAST
integrates up the differential equation from a pre-calculated starting point. Unlike
CMBFAST 3.2 our ranges of integration continue into the Chi > pi/2
region for closed models. We avoid problems with stability of the
integration (contamination with the irregular solution) by cutting off
the integration when the errors become important (where the values in the
dissipative tail are becoming small). This leads to very small errors,
and allows for a much simpler scheme than that used in CMBFAST 3.2 where
the symmetry of the Bessel functions is used to extend to the Chi> Pi/2 region.
<P>
From the user's point of view the main point is that this code is
rather faster than CMBFAST in many cases. Assuming same recombination history CAMB agrees with the CMBFAST 4.5 high precision TT calculation to < 1% at low l, and about 0.3% at l>100 in concordance flat models. If CAMB is run with high precision options the agreement is nearly 0.1% at high l. The polarized spectra also agree well except around the first dip in the EE spectrum with reionization (see CAMB's accurate_reionization parameter).
<P>
Note that as of March 2008 CAMB's reionization parameterization is slightly different to CMBFAST. CMBFAST 4.5.1 also uses an old version of RECFAST.
<P>
CMBFAST 3.2 introduced an include file for adjusting the
l-sampling. In CAMB this is done automatically depending on the model,
so there is no need to modify the l-sampling by hand.
<P>
CMBFAST uses the flat sky and Limber approximation and works from the transfer
functions to work out the lensing potential, CAMB uses the full result (agreement is excellent). CAMB uses a full-sky correlation function method rather than the flat sky approx (about max 0.4% effect on EE).
<P>
CMBFAST 4 uses a "k-splitting" to allow rapid computation of grids of
models to reasonable accuracy. If you need to generate a large number
of models and accuracy is not vital using CMBFAST 4 would probably
save you some time and effort. CMBFAST 4 also supports some extended models not supported by CAMB, e.g. 5-D models.
<P>
CAMB is in Fortran 90 and is more modularized, so using different initial power spectra, modified equations, etc. is often just a case of modifying one or two files and re-compiling.
<P>
Note that the conventions for the polarization power spectra output by CAMB agree with those of CMBFAST. This sign convention for the cross-correlation C_l^TE spectrum differs from the definitions in <A
HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9911481">astro-ph/9911481</A>. As from CMBFAST 4.2 the initial power spectrum normalization conventions also agree.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>camb.f90</B>
<P>
Main wrapper routines for running CAMB in your programs. Add "use
camb" to your programs and call CAMB_GetResults to generate output
from a set of model parameters (specified in the CAMBparams type -
defined at the top of modules.f90). You can call
CAMB_ValidateParams(P) to check that the parameter set is valid, use
CAMB_GetAge to compute the age of a model in gigayears, and
CAMB_GetCls to retrieve the computed Cls. The results can also be
accessed directly using the arrays in the ModelData module (defined in modules.f90).<P>
Sample programs tester.f90 and sigma8.f90 are supplied showing how to
use CAMB from your own programs. You can also use CAMB_GetTransfers to access the C_l transfer functions directly without incorporating the initial power spectrum.
</P>
<B>cmbmain.f90</B>
<P>
The main subroutine that does integrations, etc. Encompasses CMBFAST's
cmbflat and cmbopen.
<P>
<B>equations.f90</B>
<P>
Files containing background and perturbation evolution equations. The
perturbations equations used are derived in the covariant approach,
fixing to the CDM (zero acceleration) frame, which are essentially
equivalent to the synchronous gauge equations.
<P>
   The file defines a module called &quot;GaugeInterface&quot; which provides
   the necessary perturbation calculation routines for
   &quot;cmbmain&quot;.
<P>
   The subroutine dtauda(a) returns dt/da and is used wherever the
   background evolution is needed. It
   can be modified for different backgrounds. You may
   also need to change the GetOmegak routine if you add additional
   components, and can edit the init_background routine to do
   additional initialization.
    <P>
   outtransf writes out the matter transfer functions.
<P>
   The "output" subroutine computes the scalar sources at a given time for a
   given wavenumber. These are the temperature, E polarization and (if
   doing lensing) the lensing source. By editing the equation for the
   lensing source it should be straightforward to compute power
   spectra for other matter tracers, e.g. for cross-correlation with
   the CMB. The lensing power spectrum is automatically computed if
   <B>DoLensing=T</B>.

<P>
<B> power_tilt.f90</B>
<P>
This file defines a module called InitialPower that returns the
initial power spectra. Change this file to use your own initial power
spectrum, change how the spectra are parameterized, or to change how
the Cls are normalized. Comments in the code explain this further.
<P>

<P>
<B> reionization.f90</B>
<P>
This file defines a module called Reionization that parameterizes the reionization history and supplies a function <B>Reionization_xe</B> that gives x<sub>e</sub> as a function of redshift. Optical depth input parameters are mapped into z<sub>re</sub> (defined as where x<sub>e</sub> is half its maximum (ex second He reionization)) using a binary search. See the CAMB <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CAMB.pdf">notes</A> for discussion. This module should be easily modifiable for alternative reionization models.
<P>
<B>halofit.f90</B><P>
Implements the NonLinear module, to calculate non linear scalings of the matter power spectrum as a function of redshift. Uses HALOFIT (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207664">astro-ph/0207664</A>, code thanks to <A HREF="http://www.astro.upenn.edu/~res">Robert Smith</A>. Note this is only reliable at the several percent level for standard &Lambda;CDM models with power law initial power spectra. This module can be replaced to use a different non-linear fitting method.

    Reads in parameters from a file of name/value pairs and calls CAMB. Modify
    this file to generate grids of models, change the parameterization, etc.

<P>
 <B> modules.f90</B>
<P>
   Various modules used by the other parts of the program, Module
   &quot;ModelParams&quot; contains most of the model parameters. Boolean vars
   flat, open and closed determine the model type.
<P>

 <B>bessels.f90</B>
<P>
   Module to calculate spherical and hyper-spherical Bessel
   functions. Hyper-spherical functions generated by use of
   either the recursion relation or Kosowsky's WKB approximation. Based on
   Arthur Kosowsky's &quot;hyperjl.c&quot;.
<P>

<B>lensing.f90</B>
<P>
  Lensing module for computing the lensed CMB power spectra from the
  unlensed spectra and a lensing power spectrum. See <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502425">astro-ph/0502425</A>.
</P>

 <B> subroutines.f90</B>
<P>
   Various subroutines for interpolation, and modified Runge-Kutta
   dverk for parallelized evolution.
<P>
<B> writefits.f90</B>
<P>
 Subroutine WriteFitsCls that uses HEALPIX routines to output power spectrum
 in FITS format.

<B>recfast.f90</B>
<P>
 RECFAST integrator for Cosmic Recombination of Hydrogen and Helium
 by Douglas Scott (with minor modifications for CMBFAST and the
 CAMB). See <A
 HREF="http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/recfast.html">RECFAST</A>
 for the original code.

<H3>Accuracy</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scalar errors should rarely exceed 0.3% for min(2500, l well into the damping tail) at default accuracy setting. See also <A HREF="#COMPARE">comparison</A> with CMBFAST. Accuracy of course assumes the model is correct, and is dependent on RECFAST being the correct ionization history; there are currently uncertainties in hydrogen recombination that may give errors around 1% at high l. Lensed C_l TT, TE and EE are accurate at the same level if l_max and k_max are set large enough (to within the approximation that the lensing potential is linear, or the accuracy of the the HALOFIT non-linear model).
<P>
 Extreme models (e.g. scale &gt; 4, h&gt;1) may give errors of 5% or more.
<P>
 Tensor errors around 2% or more on small scales (e.g. due to l-interpolation). Low l accuracy somewhat worse than scalars (typically < 1%).
<P>
 Hierarchy truncation errors up to 5% at high l (&gt;1500) in some
   closed models
<P>
 You can improve or check accuracy (or increase speed) by changing
   global accuracy parameters at the bottom of the params.ini input file. Convergence and stability can be checked using the <A HREF="http://camb.info/test_suite.tar.gz">test suite</A>.
